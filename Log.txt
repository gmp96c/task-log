Keep an outline of things going on so I can make sure I remember when I get back to it.
Current status is having the delete function work, it requires the User ID to process the request and I'm going to have it auto-include on requests missing it for the current user on the backend.

Delete working, I am just passing user down as a prop since oyu can't set defaults for graphql queries like that, works much better this way honestly. Caching works as well is pretty nice.
Next task is getting adding new/old tasks working and updating the cache.

Got adding existing ones working by updating user, still need to have adding new tasks update the cache. Will do that tomorrow.

Adding/delete tasks in all methods updates the cache properly, next add tip functionality?

Tips relations is broken fix that.

Fixed tip relations, also set up the basic modes I will use for the layout. Next task is to complete each mode or figure more out current plan is.
One each individual task have
-Base mode, what there is now, maybe different controls
-Settings mode, delete/edit Tips


Also a global history for logs including on removed tasks

Dropping d/b to change any info will be annoying, setting up some initial data that I can just use instead

Disable authed relationships and some hooks for data initilization

I got the tip display working next two tasks in order to do are

Set up the tip component so you can click to add/remove it -- DONE
have pinned by count modify when people do that -- DONE

When that's all done work on logs/history I guess?

Get access control for tip pinned by working - This works, add count now.

Just using meta tag for pinned by all taht's done, cping whats left above.

have area to add Tips
Figure out how to show list, change functionality when people add/search
Search bar on top filters, same click to activate/disable functionality, and add adds it to list below

Adding tips adds to cache on task view, but not in TIp dialog, tip dialog cache edit in progress

Got tip caching working, and fixed a bug with disabling an active task. Using a similar cache update function for both made updating them pretty easy. Diving into apollo dev tools really helps to clarify things remember to do that for any future issues.

Basic tip functionality is done I think? Count is handled by meta, cache works for both. Going to move down the todo list again, oops need to add filter, okay got that added in a really nice hook.

-Add Log mode, obvious
-View logs, view history of all your logs related to this task.
-Maybe add option to delete your create tips? Maybe not.
-unit testing? Might be good before moving into the log views
I'll work on adding the log views

Seems like a good time to get unit tests set up before the additional complexity of the log page.

Realized I still hadn't made the sign up page after test work to do is -
-Add Log mode, obvious DONE
-View logs, view history of all your logs related to this task. DONE
-Create error for if log is too long, find smaller ways to store? DONE1

-Sign up
Just this then style I reckon?

pulling logs for all users, change log query to get from user? Change acl on log read if that's the case.

Everything is working as far as I can tell, just styles now really.

I think it's good for a basic release to get people using it, still needs some tidying up but I think all the functionality basically works. Need to clean up and make some decent data.
Immediate thing will be figuring out a hosting solution, looking at render.com.

Post release:
Remove active tasks from add new task search.
More testing, E2E and unit.
